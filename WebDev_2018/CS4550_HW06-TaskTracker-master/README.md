# CS4550_HW06-TaskTracker

## Main design decisions:
- As nice as the cards from class were, I went with importing the tasks index page as the main list on my feed of tasks. This was so I could integrate [rummage](https://github.com/aditya7iyengar/rummage_phoenix), which let me do pagination and some other cool stuff.
- Everything routes back to the feed page, so you don't have to get confused by weird routes
- Matt Conniff - github.com/mttcnnff - had a great idea to do a dropdown of the users instead of the user ids so you didn't get screwed up when creating a new task. He gave me a lot of help on that part!
